# [1st Canadian Division HQ](http://1stcdndiv.com)

A Web GIS Platform created for Canadian NEO & DART operations.

## Aim

* Open source and Unclassified platform
* Creating a mapping platform with a common look in feel

## Quickstart

You must first install the required Python module.

1. Flask - Will be your lightweight Python webserver

2. Geocoder - A pure python Geocoding module.

To install these modules, we will be using Pip as our Python install manager.

```bash
$ pip install flask geocoder
```

To run the webserver, simply go in your command prompt and run the Flask application.

```bash
$ python runserver.py
```

Then go to your web browser and you will be able to see your Web map application.
